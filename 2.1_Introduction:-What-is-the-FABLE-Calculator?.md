The FABLE Calculator is an Excel accounting tool used to study the potential evolution of food and land-use systems over the period 2000-2050. The impact of different policies as well as changes in the drivers of these systems can be tested through the combination of a large number of scenarios. The FABLE Calculator focuses on agriculture as the main driver of land-use change. It includes 76 agricultural raw and processed products from the crop and livestock sectors ([Appendix 1](https://github.com/KatyaPerezGuzman/FABLE-Calculator-Documentation/wiki/3.1_Appendix-1:-List-of-products-and-product-mappings)) and relies extensively on the FAOSTAT database for input data. In each 5-year time step over 2000-2050, the level of agricultural activities, land use, food consumption, trade, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is computed according to selected scenarios. The current version of the FABLE Calculator is a light Excel file (<6 MB) which contains country or regional historical data in the grey “DATA” sheets, the formulas for the calculation in the green “CALCULATION” sheets, the scenarios definition and selection in the light red “SCENARIOS” sheets, and the visualization of the main results in the yellow “INDICATORS” sheets (Figure 1). Users can replace data from global databases with national or sub-national data. This is not an optimization tool and prices are only used ex-post to compute production and trade value (i.e. they do not influence the results and results do not influence commodity prices, contrary to economic models).

I do not like the way this looks (says Katya)
