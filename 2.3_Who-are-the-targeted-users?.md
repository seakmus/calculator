The [Food, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Land-Use, and Energy (FABLE) Consortium](https://www.foodandlandusecoalition.org/fableconsortium) is a collaborative initiative, operating as part of the Food and Land-Use Coalition, working to understand how countries can transition towards sustainable land-use and food systems. The Consortium is a global network of researchers organized by country teams who are building the tools and analyses for integrated food and land-use planning at the national and global level (Schmidt-Traub, Obersteiner, & Mosnier, 2019). Before joining the Consortium, few country teams had developed a model that covered both food and land systems. Therefore, the FABLE Calculator was developed with the objective of providing a model to each country team as quickly as possible to allow them to make first projections of their food and land-use systems up to 2050. Seventeen country models (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, Indonesia, India, Mexico, Malaysia, Russia, Rwanda, Sweden, the UK, and the USA) and seven rest-of-the world (RoW) regional models were produced to generate sustainable pathways. The FABLE Consortium played a key role in identifying problems and mistakes in the Calculator and in suggesting improvements.
The FABLE calculator has been used to play the first FABLE Scenathon, a process where the same standardized indicators derived from the modeled pathways of all country teams and rest of the world regions were submitted to an online platform (also called Linker tool) which allowed the comparison of the pathways, the aggregation at the global level, and the computation of trade imbalance for each product and year. Several iterations have been used to balance trade and to try to collaboratively align national pathways with the global FABLE targets. The results and methodology of this first Scenathon are described in the [FABLE Report 2019](https://www.foodandlandusecoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Fable-interim-report_complete-low.pdf) (FABLE, 2019).
More generally, the FABLE Calculator can be used by anyone who is interested in integrated analyses of food and land-use systems. It is especially suitable for people with no or limited previous experience in modelling.
